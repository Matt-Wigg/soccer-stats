You can search for any tracked club across the globe by using the <b>countries</b> & <b>leagues</b> dropdown menus located above the league table component. First, select a country you would like to explore from the countries dropdown. Once a country is selected, all available leagues for that country will display in the league dropdown menu. After making your selections, the latest table results will appear below; from there, you can start adding clubs to your list and browse their latest statistics. 
<p><b>Pro-tip:</b> You can also type directly into the search dropdowns to filter your criteria faster!</p>
