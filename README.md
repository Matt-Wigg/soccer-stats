## Overview

Soccer Stats allows you to search, follow, and track any club around the world for the 2020 / 2021 season. No longer do you need to jump around from club website to club website to find your favorite team's latest fixtures, results, team rosters, and more! By using real-time statistics pulled directly via API-Football, you can search for any club across the globe, add them to your favorites list, and browse their latest statistics!

## Features

<br>**Add & remove teams to your 'My Clubs' list**<br>
Quickly access your followed club's information by adding them to your 'My Clubs' list. To add a team to your list, search for the club via the [country & league search feature](**search-countries-&-leagues), then click on the club displayed in the current league table. The club will then automatically appear in the list for easy access. Add as many clubs as you like - there is no limit. If you no longer wish to track a club, you can remove it from your list by clicking on the corresponding remove button.
